## Understanding the Game

### Stats (Out of 15)
Each hero has 5 stats:
- **Vigor** - Physical endurance
- **Combat** - Fighting ability  
- **Speed** - Agility
- **Intellect** - Intelligence
- **Charisma** - Social skills

**Starting stats:** 0-5 each (random)
**Max stats:** 15 each (upgrade with skill points)

### Coverage System
- Each mission has a **shaded zone** on a 36-slice wheel
- Each hero covers certain slices
- **100% coverage = Auto success!**
- **Less than 100% = RNG roll** (bouncing ball)

### Disruptions (25% chance)
- Random events during missions
- 3 choices (hidden stat requirements)
- Success/failure affects mission outcome

### Progression
- Heroes earn XP from missions
- Level up → Get skill points
- Spend skill points to increase stats (up to 15)

## Tips for Success

1. **Balance your team** - Don't just pick the strongest heroes
2. **Check coverage** - You need to fill the mission's shaded zone
3. **Meet stat requirements** - Team totals must match mission needs
4. **Upgrade strategically** - Focus on stats your team uses most
